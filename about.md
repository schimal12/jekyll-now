In this section I will post several webpages that are related to Cybersecurity Education and/or Practice. 

1. Root Me: Capture the Flag. (https://www.root-me.org/)

* Here we will find several trials of different types
  * App Script.
  * App System. 
  * Cracking.
  * Cryptanalysis.
  * Forensic.
  * Network.
  * Programming.
  * Realist.
  * Steganography.
  * Web - Client.
  * Web - Server.

2. Expoit Exercises (https://exploit-exercises.com/)
  * Here we will find a variety of virtual machines, documentation and challenges that can be used to learn about a 
variety of computer security issues such as privilege escalation, vulnerability analysis, exploit development, debugging, 
reverse engineering, and general cyber security issues.
  * Nebula:  Simple and intermediate challenges that cover Linux privilege escalation, common scripting language issues, and file system race conditions.
  * Protostar:  Introduces basic memory corruption issues such as buffer overflows, format strings and heap exploitation under “old-style” Linux system that does not have any form of modern exploit mitigiation systems enabled.
  * Fusion: Memory corruption, format strings and heap exploitation but this time focusing on more advanced scenarios and modern protection system.
